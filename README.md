# Smart-Message Box with Live Character Counter

This project is a simple and responsive message input component built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a live character counter that updates in real time as the user types, enforces a maximum character limit, and displays a warning when the limit is reached. A Clear button allows users to reset the input field and counter instantly.
